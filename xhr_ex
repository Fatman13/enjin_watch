Suddenly people everywhere are wearing face-masks in addition to the \u2018social distancing\u2019 practices that are being put in place (stay 1.5 metres away from other people at all times).   One wonders what the 'new normal' might look like at the other side of this... will handshakes ever return as a form of greeting?\n\nThe messaging from governments about the use and value of masks has not been exactly clear.  The initial advice has been that face masks should only be worn by front-line medical staff or by people who have contracted  COVID-19 in order to protect others.  However emerging research seems to suggest that if the general public are wearing masks this can help to protect individuals and 'flatten the curve'.\n\nThese N95 \/ P2 masks have quickly been snapped up by preppers who got in early, and they are nearly impossible to get now.  There are reports of hospitals having to ration the use of masks due to the chronic shortage of them worldwide.\n\n \n\nThis is an important and rare item you will want in your anti-corona cache.","image":"https:\/\/cdn.enjinx.io\/metadata\/raw\/890bae4bc70aaa0ef6a286e97217a0b37cd32e55\/0534fc2e4435ba7255104661fa845d24005f82a2.jpeg","meltValue":"3.000000000000000000","platform":{"id":3585,"name":"Anti coronavirus cache 1st Gen","flags":0}},"sale":{"unitPrice":"262.000000000000000000","useEnj":1,"currency":6450,"seller":{"address":"0x0e790b120dcc7785b539a3c1ac26579c1e646e9f","contract":0,"miner":0,"name":null}}},{"id":219271,"event":"list","timeStamp":1586594895,"blockNumber":9849962,"logIndex":108,"address":{"address":"0x0e790b120dcc7785b539a3c1ac26579c1e646e9f","contract":0,"miner":0,"name":null},"transactionHash":"0xb3f6b05dc2d95e5506eff48bf816cc1e4a98172de8d6ceb9a8d4d6ed8aefa442","amount":1,"item":{"id":87390553,"token":"0x108000000000072900000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c","tokenIndex":28,"name":"Research Break Thru #28","flags":0,"description":"Scientists and medical personnel around the world are working around the clock to improve testing for COVID-19, and also develop a vaccine that will protect the world against this rising spectre.\n\nBits and pieces of news trickles out here and there about progress being made, but the consistent message is that any vaccine is likely to be 12-18 months away.  \n\nSo this is not so much a physical item that you store in your cache, but rather it is a hope for your family, community and the world that you carry in your heart.\n\n","image":"https:\/\/cdn.enjinx.io\/metadata\/raw\/4dace6652840c311d2ee5d3c5a894b7411b462de\/fe32ab01deb185d83c7b09cbcaf2ff248c41444e.png","meltValue":"6.000000000000000000","platform":{"id":3585,"name":"Anti coronavirus cache 1st Gen","flags":0}},"sale":{"unitPrice":"447.000000000000000000","useEnj":1,"currency":6450,"seller":{"address":"0x0e790b120dcc7785b539a3c1ac26579c1e646e9f","contract":0,"miner":0,"name":null}}},{"id":219270,"event":"list","timeStamp":1586592504,"blockNumber":9849782,"logIndex":75,"address":{"address":"0x11ce0dda3cbfb94993f8d4d042266319b043c30f","contract":0,"miner":0,"name":null},"transactionHash":"0x8d07c5e80637d64a322f195deeb5499e29fa47e98b5dae6be83cb97ccf7b4932","amount":1,"item":{"id":77052989,"token":"0x50800000000000280000000000000000000000000000000000000000000021d5","tokenIndex":8661,"name":"Mike #8661","flags":0,"description":"Arngrim Spankblaze the Third, Earl of Neo-Kattegat, the Hungoverlord, Stealer of Titanwine,\u201d commonly known as \u201cMike,\u201d is likely the least fortunate individual in the entire multiverse.\n\nAn avid drinker\u2014but also a brave warrior, Mike dared to steal the only bottle of Fomorphic Nectar ever made.
